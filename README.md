# Parser
This code will need to be opened with racket,
In this grammar, each physical line of source code begins with a line number, an integer greater than 0. There is no requirement that source lines be numbered in increasing order (though they'd be executed in numerical order). This grammar is not case-sensitive. (Therefore case is insufficient to distinguish between identifiers. Var, var, and VAR are all the same identifier.) There must be at least one character whitespace after the line number before the beginning of the first statement of that line. More than one statement is possible on a physical line of source code, but the end of the physical line always marks the end of a statement. In this grammar, identifiers are strictly alphabetic (no numeric characters). GOTO 1234 is a statement, as is GOTO1234. GOTOTOWN is an identifier.
